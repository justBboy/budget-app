# budget-app

this is a budget app very basic using vanilla javascript.
It was created to help advance your vanilla javascript power so you can know how javascript really works
And avoid too much abstractions which isn't quite great.
This is a very basic budget app that just takes budget amount, the expense and the expense amount and calculates
how much the balance will be.
this uses html, css(bootstrap) and vanilla javascript
